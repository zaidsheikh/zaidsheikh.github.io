I am a Senior Research Programmer in [Prof. Graham Neubig's lab](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~neulab/) at the Language Technologies Institute of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), working on research projects involving machine learning, multi-lingual natural language processing, machine translation etc.

Bio
======

I got my Masters degree in Computer Science at the Language Technologies Institute of [Carnegie Mellon University](https://www.cmu.edu/), specializing in Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing. After graduating, I continued working at CMU as a full-time research programmer and was involved in a number of research projects including [IARPA BABEL](https://www.iarpa.gov/research-programs/babel) (spoken term detection in low-resource languages), [DARPA LORELEI](https://www.darpa.mil/program/low-resource-languages-for-emergent-incidents) (identifying topics, entities and events in low-resource languages, with an emphasis on humanitarian and disaster relief situations), [DARPA AIDA](https://www.darpa.mil/program/active-interpretation-of-disparate-alternatives) (detecting alternative interpretations/narratives of real-world events in text and multimedia) and [DARPA KAIROS](https://www.darpa.mil/program/knowledge-directed-artificial-intelligence-reasoning-over-schemas) (understand complex events described in text and multimedia by identifying, linking and temporally sequencing sub-events and their participants).

I also worked at a speech recognition startup ([Voci Technologies](https://www.vocitec.com/), now part of Medallia Inc) for more than a year, where I was fortunate enough to be part of the team that built Vociâ€™s core speech analytics software from the ground up. This product employed state-of-the-art speech recognition, transcription, and text analysis technologies (all built in-house) to help users visualize and gain insights from call center audio and other sources of real-world conversational speech.

Currently I am working with Prof. Graham Neubig on a project funded by [Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) Singapore](https://www.dsta.gov.sg/home). The project deals with social media summarization and narrative generation for humanitarian aid and disaster response situations, specifically in the low-resource languages setting.
