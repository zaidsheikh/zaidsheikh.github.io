I am a Senior Research Programmer in Graham Neubig's lab at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, working on research projects involving machine learning, multi-lingual natural language processing, machine translation etc.

Bio
======

I got my Masters degree in Computer Science at the Language Technologies Institute of Carnegie Mellon University, specializing in Speech Recognition and Natural Language Processing. After graduating, I continued working at CMU as a full-time research programmer and was involved in a number of research projects including IARPA BABEL (spoken term detection in low-resource languages), DARPA LORELEI (identifying topics, entities and events in low-resource languages, with an emphasis on humanitarian and disaster relief situations), DARPA AIDA (detecting alternative interpretations/narratives of real-world events in text and multimedia) and DARPA KAIROS (understand complex events described in text and multimedia by identifying, linking and temporally sequencing sub-events and their participants). I also worked at a speech recognition startup (Voci Technologies, now part of Medallia Inc) for more than a year, where I was fortunate enough to be part of the team that built Vociâ€™s core speech analytics software from the ground up. This product employed state-of-the-art speech recognition, transcription, and text analysis technologies (all built in-house) to help users visualize and gain insights from call center audio and other sources of real-world conversational speech. Currently I am working at CMU on a project funded by Defence Science and Technology Agency (DSTA) Singapore, it involves social media summarization and narrative generation for humanitarian aid and disaster response, specifically in the low-resource languages setting.
